## Getting started

```sh

cd NESFit

# When you want to "save" some modification you have made:
git add file1 file2 ...
git commit -m "Nice description of the changes you made"
# Example description: Replace hard-coded values with constants

# When you want "push" a modification from your computer to this repository:
git push

# When you want to "pull" the modifications from this repository:
git pull --rebase

# NEVER EVER DO THE FOLLOWING NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE READ IN THE INTERNET:
# git push -f
# (unless you really know what you are doing and are willing to re-do work
# other persons have already did in case you mess up)
```
